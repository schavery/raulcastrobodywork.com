Informed Consent and Massage Policies (Please read & initial)

I understand that the massage is for the purpose of stress reduction, relief from muscular tension or spasm. _____

I understand that the massage therapist does not diagnose illness, disease, or any further
physical or mental disorders. As such, the massage therapist does not prescribe medical treatment or pharmaceuticals, nor do they perform spinal manipulations. _____

I understand that massage is not a substitute for medical treatment or diagnoses and that it is recommended that I see a physician for any physical ailments that I may have.  _____

I understand that it is my responsibility to inform the massage therapist of any changes to this information.   _____

I understand that if I experience any unusual discomfort during my massage sessions it is my responsibility to verbally inform the massage therapist at the time that it is being experienced so that they can adjust the pressure or technique being used.  _____

I understand that there is no stated or implied guarantee of success or effectiveness for bodywork/massage sessions.  It is my choice to receive bodywork/massage and I give my consent for bodywork/massage.  _____
 
Cancellation Policy - Your appointment time has been set aside especially for you.   A 24 hour cancellation notice is required if you are unable to keep the appointment. If I do not receive 24 hour notice you will be sent a bill for 50% of the cost for the missed appointment, and in the future you will be required to give a credit card when booking your appointment.

I agree to notify Raul Castro by phone with at least 24 hours notice if I am currently feeling sick, or have been sick within the past 7 days (ie. Flu, cold etc.) I understand that my appointment may have to be rescheduled until any illness has passed.  Likewise, I understand that if the massage therapist is feeling unwell I may have to postpone my appointment for a later date and time.  _______


Privacy Policy - All written records and massage sessions are kept strictly confidential and will not be shared with any outside establishment, individuals, organizations, or medical facilities without explicit written consent from the client (you) or the client�s legal guardian. Unless legally required by local, state, or federal subpoena, summons, or other court order.  _____  

I acknowledge that the information I have provided on this form is correct and current to the best of my knowledge. _____
