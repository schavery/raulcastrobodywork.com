      <h2>R.H.<br>
      Ergonomics Coordinator<br>
      Alameda, CA</h2>

      <p>I've been seeing Raul for about a year and I'm finally
      ready to let y'all in on the best-kept massage secret in the
      East Bay. I've had lots of massages, even physical therapy,
      and his Compression Therapy technique is the ONLY thing that
      got rid of the horrible knots in my neck &amp; shoulders from
      too many tense hours at a desk.</p>

      <p>He also does out-calls; he massaged me and my bridal party
      in our hotel as we got ready for my wedding and I was so
      relaxed walking down the aisle!</p><br>

      <h2>Mark M.<br>
      L.M.F.T.<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>As a therapist that refers people often for massage and
      bodywork, I can say that Raul has a gift for healing. He
      creates a very safe space and tunes into each client to
      provide a massage that is wonderfully restorative and
      profoundly relaxing.</p>

      <p>He combines a breadth of knowledge with an intuition and
      perceptiveness that can take massage beyond stress relief
      into the realm of body work- healing injuries and releasing
      emotional blocks. And he goes at the pace and the depth that
      is comfortable for each person.</p>

      <p>I can't recommend him more highly!</p><br>

      <h2>Dina M.<br>
      CMT<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>I've been a massage therapist for over 23 years and I've
      received many massages over the years and Raul is the best
      massage therapist...hands down.</p>

      <p>I am so impressed with his skill and intuitive nature. He
      knew exactly what areas needed attention and he was able to
      work very deep and yet I never once felt my muscles contract
      from inappropriate pressure. He works in a very slow manner
      allowing him to penetrate the deeper layers of muscle. I have
      chronic low back pain and had surgery many years ago and as a
      result I have a lot of scar tissue and the low back area and
      hips are in much need of deep work. For some reason most
      massage therapists are either afraid of working too deep in
      that area for fear of hurting me, or they just don't have the
      skill to know what to do. Raul was able to release much of
      the stored tightness and tension and the end result was more
      mobility and less pain. And finally, I need to tell you about
      the man, Raul. He is so sweet and kind and gentle. I
      instantly felt comfortable and safe with him.</p><br>

      <h2>Rachael H.<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>When Raul works on you he listens and then zeroes in on
      the places where you're holding tension. It's impossible to
      overstate how good he is at this. He then leans in and works
      the tension out of you, talking you through it. Within the
      first fifteen minutes of my session, we'd figured something
      out that had been tripping me up emotionally for about a
      month. Another wonderful thing is that during the massage,
      with his guidance, you are working with your body as much as
      he is. I can't recommend him highly enough.</p><br>

      <h2>Cindy P.<br>
      CMT<br>
      Alameda, CA</h2>

      <p>As massage therapist I am very picky and extremely hard to
      please. Raul is definitely by far the best massage therapist
      ever!!!!!!! His massage is different then any massage I have
      ever gotten. Raul has healing hands and he wks hard to get
      all the knots out, which I love! I like deep, deep tissue and
      the pressure was perfect. I highly recommend him! I wish I
      would have found him long time ago.</p><br>

      <h2>Susan Mullen<br>
      Chiropractor<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>I have NEVER before received such intuitive, quality care
      from a therapist. I was a massage therapist for 15 yrs before
      becoming a Chiropractor. And I have received thousands of
      hours of massage therapy. I always feel renewed, revitalized
      and restored after my sessions with Raul. He is, by far, the
      BEST! Dr. Sue Mullen</p><br>

      <h2>Cynthia Boyd.<br>
      Chiropractor - Symmetry Spine &amp; Wellness Center<br>
      Alameda, CA</h2>

      <p>Raul has a very unique technique. No boring massage school
      basics I must say. He has created a technique based on an
      impressive massage education, and his ability to tap in to
      amazing intuition. I had the pleasure of working with Raul at
      one time. I actually hired him to work on some of my
      patients. I am a chiropractor here in Alameda, and find
      massage to be very important complimentary treatment to
      chiropractic care. I have added Raul to my short list of
      recommended massage therapists. Body workers like Raul are
      hard to come by, and deserve special recognition.</p><br>

      <h2>Lyly P.<br>
      Emeryville, CA</h2>

      <p>Raul and I sat and talked about my life style, work,
      exercise regimen. I asked ignorant questions about his
      technique and entrusted myself to his proposed comprehensive
      method.</p>

      <p>I've never had someone read my body so well.</p>

      <p>Earlier while undressing, I cynically interpreted a sign
      that read, &ldquo;GRATITUDE,&rdquo; to mean, &ldquo;don't
      forget to tip me. &rdquo; After, while putting my clothes
      back on, I reread the sign and it resonated different truths.
      It's a stance that Raul lives by. I can attest to that by the
      humble and honest way he approached his work on my
      body.</p><br>

      <h2>Elynne G.<br>
      CMT<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>I've been seeing Raul for over 2 years. He's the
      best!!!</p>

      <p>A year ago I walked in to his office with a back issue. He
      took one look at me and said lets work on your feet, I was
      thinking crazy boy. (I forgot I hurt my foot two weeks
      before) I could not believe how much better I felt after he
      worked my feet. The universe has given him a gift.</p><br>

      <h2>Hollyce J.<br>
      Oakland, CA</h2>

      <p>I went to see Raul for a sprained ankle that was causing
      me to walk/lurch around awkwardly and thus, various other
      parts of my body started seizing up... my calf, quad, hip,
      rear, lower back, shoulders and neck!? To make matters worse,
      all this body tension had caused me to have a nasty headache
      for a week.</p>

      <p>In one day, post massage a la Raul Castro, my headache is
      completely gone. While my ankle is still sprained (Raul is
      not a witch doctor) it feels more fluid and I'll be a bit
      more confident out on the trails with my dogs today. Couldn't
      be more grateful!</p><br>

      <h2>Eric V.<br>
      Alameda, CA</h2>

      <p>I've been to see Raul several times for issues ranging
      from mobility limiting muscle injuries to just needing to
      relax and unwind. I've never been disappointed, expect for
      when my time was up. He has an uncanny ability to listen to
      what your body needs when you may not be able to adequately
      express it yourself. I won't go anywhere else if I don't have
      to.</p>
