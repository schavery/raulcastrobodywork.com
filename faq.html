      <h2>Where Will My Massage or Bodywork Session Take
      Place?</h2>

      <p>Your bodywork session will take place in a warm,
      comfortable, quiet room. An audio environment or music may be
      played to help you relax. You will lie on a table especially
      designed for your comfort. Most often the session will begin
      with the patient lying face down and your face rested in the
      headrest. You should be under the provided sheet and blanket
      and have your body covered before summoning the
      therapist.</p><br>

      <h2>Must I Be Completely Undressed?</h2>

      <p>Most massage and bodywork techniques are traditionally
      performed with the client unclothed. You should undress to
      your level of comfort. You will be properly draped during the
      entire session. My sessions are oil-based (Nutrogena Light
      Sesame Oil.) If you have sensitivity to that you must inform
      me ahead of time.</p><br>

      <h2>Will the Practitioner Be Present When I Disrobe?</h2>

      <p>The practitioner will leave the room while you undress,
      relax onto the table, and cover yourself with a clean
      sheet.</p><br>

      <h2>Will I Be Covered During the Session?</h2>

      <p>You will be properly draped at all times to keep you warm
      and comfortable. Only the area being worked on will be
      exposed.</p><br>

      <h2>What Parts of My Body Will Be Massaged?</h2>

      <p>You and the practitioner will discuss the desired outcome
      of your session. This will determine which parts of your body
      require massage. A typical full body session will include
      work on your back, arms, legs, feet, hands, head, neck, and
      shoulders. For sessions requiring deeper work it will be
      necessary to work the glutes, hip flexors, and psoas muscles
      and may require palpation of the sacrum and coccyx. If
      working the chest area we will address the collarbone,
      pectoral muscles and rib attachments 1, 2 and 3 at the
      manubrium (breast plate) When this is necessary your
      therapist will describe the intention prior to performing the
      action and get your express permission to do so. You will not
      be touched on or near your genitals (male or female) or
      breasts (female).</p><br>

      <h2>What Will the Massage or Bodywork Feel Like?</h2>

      <p>It depends on the techniques used. Many massage therapists
      use a form of Swedish massage, which is often a baseline for
      practitioners. In a general Swedish massage, your session may
      start with broad, flowing strokes that will help calm your
      nervous system and relax exterior muscle tension. A light
      sesame oil is used to allow your muscles to be massaged
      without causing excessive friction to the skin. The oil also
      helps hydrate your skin. You should communicate immediately
      if you feel any discomfort so that another approach may be
      taken. Massage and bodywork are most effective when your body
      is not resisting. As your body becomes relaxed, pressure will
      gradually be increased to relax specific areas and relieve
      areas of muscular tension. This will include use of the
      therapists fingers, knuckles, forearm, elbows or other
      devices specifically designed for deep tissue or trigger
      point work. You may also experience &ldquo;tapping&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;knocking&rdquo; on certain areas. This technique is
      used to assist in the alleviation of trapped energies or
      tissue binding. There will be muscles and tendons that feel
      crunchy or gritty. This is a normal sensation and we will
      work on dissolving these adhesions and reduce or eliminate
      the causes of these sensations. Working on an
      &ldquo;intensity level scale&rdquo; of 1-10 (with 1 being no
      sensation to 10 being highly sensitive) your practitioner
      works between a 4 and 7. There will be an occasional 8 and
      you will be guided into it with breath work and compassion.
      It will usually only last for a moment just before the muscle
      releases and you should feel a sense of great relief
      immediately afterwards.</p><br>

      <h2>What Should I Do During the Massage or Bodywork
      Session?</h2>

      <p>Many people just close their eyes and completely relax,
      communicating if/when they need more or less pressure,
      another blanket, or anything else relevant to the session.
      There will be times when the therapist requires free movement
      of the arms or legs to help pinpoint certain deeper muscles.
      If the patient attempts to &ldquo;help&rdquo; by lifting the
      limb additional muscles will get involved and obstruct the
      therapy. Other therapies will require the patient to perform
      certain movements requested by the therapist so as to
      actively involve the muscles in release. This is all a part
      of the open dialogue and communication that will take place
      during the session. Often, people are curious about what
      techniques are being used or what muscles are being
      addressed. Feel free to ask any questions before, during and
      after the session as I find that having knowledge about the
      process helps in the healing.</p><br>

      <h2>How Long Will the Session Last?</h2>

      <p>A full-body session with Raul Castro Bodywork lasts
      approximately 2 hours. A 1 hour appointment only allows time
      for a partial session to address specific areas such as neck
      and shoulders, back or legs and feet. Many people prefer an
      1.5 to 2 hour session for optimal relaxation.</p><br>

      <h2>How Will I Feel After the Massage or Bodywork
      Session?</h2>

      <p>Most people feel very relaxed. Some experience freedom
      from long-term aches and pains developed from tension or
      repetitive activity. After an initial period of feeling
      slowed down, people often experience increased energy,
      heightened awareness, and greater productivity, which can
      last for several days. You may experience tenderness and
      sensitivity if we've opted to do deep tissue or trigger point
      work. Because we are manipulating soft tissue it can be
      expected to feel a bit sore afterwards. This is natural and
      will fade soon after the session. It is always recommended,
      if it's available, to take a hot bath with Epsom salts to
      relieve your muscles after a bodywork session. Also, it is
      important to drink plenty of water to assist the body in
      filtering out released energies from the session.</p><br>

      <h2>What Are the Benefits of Massage and Bodywork?</h2>

      <p>Massage and bodywork can help release chronic muscular
      tension and pain, improve circulation, increase joint
      flexibility, reduce mental and physical fatigue and stress,
      promote faster healing of injured muscular tissue, improve
      posture, and reduce blood pressure. Massage and bodywork is
      also known to promote better sleep, improve concentration,
      reduce anxiety and create an overall sense of
      well-being.</p><br>

      <h2>Are There Any Medical Conditions That Would Make Massage
      or Bodywork Inadvisable?</h2>

      <p>Yes. That's why it's imperative that, before you begin
      your session, the practitioner asks general health questions.
      It is very important that you inform the practitioner of
      pregnancy, health problems or medications you are taking. If
      you are under a doctor's care, it is strongly advised that
      you receive a written recommendation for massage or bodywork
      prior to any session. Your practitioner may require a
      recommendation or approval from your doctor.</p><br>

      <h2>Should I give a gratuity to my massage therapist?</h2>

      <p>Massage Therapists are in the service industry just like
      Estheticians, Barbers, Food Servers and Bartenders. We are
      hands-on and at your service throughout the entire session
      and we do our best to ensure that you are comfortable by all
      means. Massage is physically demanding work and we are
      grateful for your considerations. If you feel that you have
      received excellent service you may choose to add a gratuity
      to the amount paid. It is customary to gift 15-20% depending
      on your experience.</p>
