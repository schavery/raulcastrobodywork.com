      <div class="rcolumn">
        <p>Simply knowing that you have an upcoming massage booked
        releases hormones and neurotransmitters that increase the
        feeling of well-being throughout your body!</p>

        <p>BUT, WAIT THERE'S MORE!</p>

        <p>Did you know that therapeutic massage has the natural
        ability to eliminate most or all of the discomforts in your
        body without the use of drugs or medications?</p>

        <p>Most people live their lives talking or thinking
        themselves into pain. There are physical manifestations or
        energetic blockages in your body right now that are
        preventing you from feeling well.</p>

        <p>They might come from an emotional response to a
        traumatic experience like an accident or a sudden change in
        life circumstance such as divorce or loss of a loved
        one.</p>

        <p>They could also stem from fear, anger or countless other
        emotional altercations that cause stress on our minds and
        bodies.</p>

        <p>The reality is that we react to these experiences on
        several different levels such as physical, emotional,
        energetic or spiritual. Our bodies react when we spend time
        replaying the story in our own minds or recounting the
        painful details to others.</p>

        <p>We are creating deeper physical effects than we might
        even be aware of.</p>

        <p>Many times people will have pain in their body for years
        and not even remember what may have caused it. These
        effects alter the way we move about in our daily lives.
        They change the way we stand, sit and sleep.In fact some
        people lose sleep due to some nagging pain that won't allow
        them to fully relax which in turn might cause frustration
        building even further pain down the line.Pain affects our
        daily lives and prohibits our bodies from functioning
        properly.Ultimately it could be robbing us of the happiness
        in life that we richly deserve!</p>

        <p>With this knowledge you now have the choice to begin to
        live a healthier life that is on it's way to freedom from
        discomfort.</p>
