            <p>Simply knowing that you have an upcoming massage booked
                releases hormones and neurotransmitters that increase the
                feeling of well-being throughout your body!</p>

            <p>BUT, WAIT THERE'S MORE!</p>

            <p>Did you know that therapeutic massage has the natural
                ability to eliminate most or all of the discomforts in your
                body without the use of drugs or medications?</p>

            <p>Most people live their lives talking or thinking
                themselves into pain. There are physical manifestations or
                energetic blockages in your body right now that are
                preventing you from feeling well.</p>

            <p>They might come from an emotional response to a
                traumatic experience like an accident or a sudden change in
                life circumstance such as divorce or loss of a loved
                one.</p>

            <p>They could also stem from fear, anger or countless other
                emotional altercations that cause stress on our minds and
                bodies.</p>

            <p>The reality is that we react to these experiences on
                several different levels such as physical, emotional,
                energetic or spiritual. Our bodies react when we spend time
                replaying the story in our own minds or recounting the
                painful details to others.</p>

            <p>We are creating deeper physical effects than we might
                even be aware of.</p>

            <p>Many times people will have pain in their body for years
                and not even remember what may have caused it. These
                effects alter the way we move about in our daily lives.
                They change the way we stand, sit and sleep.In fact some
                people lose sleep due to some nagging pain that won't allow
                them to fully relax which in turn might cause frustration
                building even further pain down the line.Pain affects our
                daily lives and prohibits our bodies from functioning
                properly.Ultimately it could be robbing us of the happiness
                in life that we richly deserve!</p>

            <p>With this knowledge you now have the choice to begin to
                live a healthier life that is on it's way to freedom from
                discomfort.</p>
