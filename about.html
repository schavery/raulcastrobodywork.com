                    for your interest in my services.</h2>
            </div>

            <p>As a Certified Advanced Massage Therapist and a graduate
                of the San Francisco School of Massage, I've learned to
                combine deep anatomical knowledge with technical skill,
                unusual intuition and selfless compassion to my practice.
                It all comes together into a modality I call BioKinetic
                Therapy. In this treatment we incorporate a variety of
                simple yet effective techniques that invite you to become
                an active participant in the session. By replicating the
                repetitive motions that add to our physical stress while
                manually pinpointing the root of the discomfort we are able
                to unwind the holding patterns and relieve the muscles.This
                is not your typical Spa Massage and I do encourage you to
                challenge yourself and possibly redefine your understanding
                of words associated with pain. For further understanding
                please read my <a href=
                                          "http://www.yelp.com/biz/raul-castro-bodywork-and-massage-alameda-2"

                that have experienced the work.</p>

            <p>With all of that said, I'm continually interested in
                learning new ways to approach symptoms that my clients
                present in the office therefore continuing education in the
                field is very important to me. I have attended Hawaiian
                Massage courses in Kauai at Mana Lomi Academy, CranioSacral
                Therapy through the Upledger Institue at Esalen in Big Sur,
                CA, Table Thai Massage at the Massage Therapy Institute in
                Davis, CA, Pre &amp; Perinatal Massage with Carole Osborne
                in Oakland, CA, Reflexology and Clinical Body Assessment at
                the McKinnon Institute in Oakland, CA.</p>

            <p>Through my own personal experiences debilitating back
                pain forced me into a painful series of back surgeries.
                After recovering, I developed a sincere interest in
                alternative healing and massage therapy to help others -
                and myself - live not just pain free but in optimum health.
                Since beginning my practice over a decade ago I've been
                graced with being one of the top-requested Bodyworkers at
                Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, CA. and an
                incredible relationship with my clientele through my
                private practice.</p>
