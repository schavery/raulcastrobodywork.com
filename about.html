<h2>Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and for your interest in my services.</h2>

<p>As a Certified Advanced Massage Therapist and a graduate of the San Francisco School of Massage, I've learned to combine deep anatomical knowledge with technical skill, unusual intuition and selfless compassion to my practice. It all comes together into a modality I call BioKinetic Therapy.  In this treatment we incorporate a variety of simple yet effective techniques that invite you to become an active participant in the session. By replicating the repetitive motions that add to our physical stress while manually pinpointing the root of the discomfort we are able to unwind the holding patterns and relieve the muscles.This is not your typical Spa Massage and I do encourage you to challenge yourself and possibly redefine your understanding of words associated with pain.  For further understanding please read my 
<a target="blank" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/raul-castro-bodywork-and-massage-alameda-2">Yelp Reviews</a>.</strong> and get a sense from the words of people that have experienced the work.</p>

<p>With all of that said, I'm continually interested in learning new ways to approach symptoms that my clients present in the office therefore continuing education in the field is very important to me.  I have attended Hawaiian Massage courses in Kauai at Mana Lomi Academy, CranioSacral Therapy through the Upledger Institue at Esalen in Big Sur, CA, Table Thai Massage at the Massage Therapy Institute in Davis, CA, Pre & Perinatal Massage with Carole Osborne in Oakland, CA, Reflexology and Clinical Body Assessment at the McKinnon Institute in Oakland, CA.

<p>Through my own personal experiences debilitating back pain forced me into a painful series of back surgeries. After recovering, I developed a sincere interest in alternative healing and massage therapy to help others - and myself - live not just pain free but in optimum health. Since beginning my practice over a decade ago I&#39;ve been graced with being one of the top-requested Bodyworkers at Pixar Animation Studios in Emeryville, CA. and I also have a private practice at Leela Yoga in Alameda, CA.</p>
