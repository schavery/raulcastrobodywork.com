<p>BioKinetic Therapy is my unique approach to bodywork that utilizes the nature of gravity, sound vibration, energy and touch to restructure the tissue on a cellular level. Combining that approach with practical techniques from Swedish, Deep Tissue, Trigger Point, Thai Massage and others, I can offer highly personalized bodywork sessions that relax, invigorate, and promote healing.</p>
